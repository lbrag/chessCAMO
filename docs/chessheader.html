<p>I decided to create this project due to my growing interest in software development. Coming from an Engineering background with Deep Learning research experience (Recent Master of Applied Science graduate), I realized that writing and developing code (both front and back end) were highly appealing to me. Thus, I spent a lot of time building upon my existing coding knowledge through online material and knew that it is time to test my knowledge on a challenging project. Additionally, I played chess (not very seriously) consistently since the age of about 4-5, so one can say that it is a very big part of my life. As a result, this project allowed me to gain valuable experience and knowledge while working on a topic that I am passionate about and have expertise in.</p>
<p><b>YouTube - Look Out</b> Be on the look out for a detailed YouTube video series explaining the various sections of this project. I feel like others could benefit from the logic involved in creating a project on this scale, which is relatively large and requires a substantial time commitment. Often times, when starting from scratch, an inexperienced software developer will quickly get overwhelmed by the complexity and decide to end the project before anything major is finished. I was in the same boat before and understand the frustration of wanting to work on an interesting project, but simply not being able to. It is often best to work on small pieces and build your way to the final product. This gives you a sense of accomplishment at each step and prevents you from experiencing the overwhelmed feeling. Let me know if you are interested in me making the videos and what you would like to see.</p>
